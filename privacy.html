        <p><strong>LAST UPDATE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY - March 16, 2018</strong></p>
        <h3>Preamble</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers all Personally Identifiable Information that is collected on this website ("Site", "This Site"), Patrickdemian.me, by Patrick Demian ("Me", "My", "I"). Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy is defined as any information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, distinguish, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. This Site complies with Canadian Federal and Provincial privacy laws and regulations including the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act.</p>
        
        <p>There are links from This Site to other websites. This Privacy Policy only applies to This Site and not of the other companies or organizations to which This Site may be linked. Links to third party websites are provided as a convenience only. I do not endorse, and I am not responsible for these linked websites.</p>
        
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information That Is Collected</h3>
        <p>Only the data you provide via the Contact Me form is collected and stored. This information is the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your email address (if provided)</li>
            <li>Your telephone number (if provided)</li>
            <li>Any Personally Identifiable Information you divulge in your message</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This does not include any information that is required for the World Wide Web to function, namely <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> headers. This information includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses</li>
            <li>User agents (Browser identities)</li>
            <li>Referers (Which page you came from last)</li>
            <li>Requested page (The page you want)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information Storage</h3>
        <p>The Personally Identifiable Information submitted in the Contact Me form is first encrypted with a Public-Private cryptographic system, and is then sent to a password protected mail server. <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> headers are stored in a password protected web server.</p>
        
        <h3>Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>This Site uses encryption via <abbr title="Secure Socket Layer">SSL</abbr> technology. This ensures that all Personally Identifiable Information is transmitted securely. Note however, this does not include <abbr title="Internet Procol">IP</abbr> addresses, as this is not covered under the scope of <abbr title="Secure Socket Layer">SSL</abbr> technology.</p>
            
        <h3>What Is Done with the Collected Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>The Personally Identifiable Information submitted in the Contact Me form is strictly used only for further correspondence. <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> headers are stored for the purposes of anonymous statistical analytics.</p>

        <h3>Dispoal of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>After 60 days, the following Personally Identifiable Information are set to be deleted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your email address (if provided)</li>
            <li>Your telephone number (if provided)</li>
            <li>Your message</li>
            <li>Your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>User agents, referers and requested pages, as well as other <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> headers not included will have their association with your <abbr title="Internet Procol">IP</abbr> address removed, anonymizing them, and are thus no longer considered Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        
        <h3>Cookie Policy</h3>
        <p>This Site does not use any cookies, first party or third party, for any purposes including but not limited to tracking of users or analytics.</p>
        
        <h3>Third-party Disclosure</h3>
        <p>I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless explicitly stated, with advance notice, in further correspondence. This does not include i) website hosting partners and other parties who assist Me in operating This Site, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential, or ii) to comply with legal requirements such as a law, regulation, warrant, subpoena or court order by Canadian and/or international authorities. In the case of authorities, Personally Identifiable Information may be required to be kept longer than the stated 60 days to comply with certain laws.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that in the case of these disclosures, Personally Identifiable Information may be stored or processed outside of Canada and may therefore be subject to different privacy laws than those applicable in Canada, including laws that require the disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to governmental authorities under circumstances that are different than those that apply in Canada.</p>
        
        <h3>Access and Modifying Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>You have the right to access, update, and correct any inaccuracies in your personal information, subject to exceptions set out in this Privacy Policy. You may request access, update, or corrections to any inaccuracies in your Personally Identifiable Information by contacting Me by email at <a href="mailto:webmaster@patrickdemian.me">webmaster@patrickdemian.me</a>. You may be asked for personal information in order to verify your identity.</p>
        
        <h3>Protection of Children Online</h3>
        <p>This Site considers the protection of children's privacy, especially online, to be of the utmost importance. I do not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from children nor do I allow them to request information through This Site.</p>
        
        <h3>Commitment to Security</h3>
        <p>To the best of My abilities, as well as of those by the website hosting partners and other parties who assist Me in operating This Site, there have been safeguards put in place to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information that is collected. Personally Identifiable Information sent via the Contact Me form is secured with both password-protected access as well as state of the art Public-Private encryption making it much more difficult to extract Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        
        <p>However, if a data breach were to occur, a notification will be posted prominently stating that a breach has occurred as soon as I can confirm the existence of such a breach. There will also be emails sent out to those who may be affected by the data breach.</p>
        
        <h3>Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>If this Privacy Policy is altered in any way, the new Privacy Policy will be placed where you can find this Privacy Policy, or alternatively at the bottom of every page on This Site. When this occurs a notification may be posted prominently stating that the Privacy Policy has been altered.</p>
        <p>You are requested to check this page for any changes before submitting Personally Identifiable Information in the Contact Me form. All Personally Identifiable Information submitted prior to the new Privacy Policy will be grandfathered in using the old Privacy Policy until the 60 day limit after which they will be deleted.</p>
        
        <h3>Acceptance of This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>By using This Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. By submitting your Personally Identifiable Information, you agree that it will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
